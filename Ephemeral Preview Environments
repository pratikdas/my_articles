## Key Takeaways

* An Ephemeral environment is used to test our applications by spinning up the environment at the time of testing and destroying it thereafter.
* The environment is a complete stack of applications and fully functional consisting of the application under test along with all its dependencies: upstream services, databases, queueing systems, etc
* They replace traditionally used static shared environments like integration or staging environments which worked well for monolithic applications. 
* They are easier to set up when all our applications are on containers
* They should also include spinning up database and populating with synthetic data.

In this article, we will understand the concepts of ephemeral environments, when they are most useful and the different ways of setting them up.
