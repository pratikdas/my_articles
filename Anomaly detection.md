# Anomaly detection in AIOps for faster incident investigations

## Key Takeaways
- Anomaly detection with AIOps helps to speed up the process of looking for anomalies in a huge volume and variety of logs and system metrics from distributed sytems that could be responsible for an incident.
- “AIOps” stands for “artificial intelligence for IT operations.” Originally coined by Gartner in 2017, it refers to leveraging the data from an application environment using AI ML.
- Anomaly Detection is a fundamental Building Blocks of AIOps traditionally focused on avoiding system disruption.
- Most observability products support anomaly detection to varying degrees
- Here we look into the process of setting up anomaly detection in an IT environment thru data collection, normalization, grouping, and applying ML algorithms to detect anomalies.

## What is Anomaly detection
In IT Operations, Anomaly Detection is a fundamental Building Blocks of AIOps – Artificial Intelligence in IT Operations. IT Operations is essentially about ensuring SLAs and the availability of IT systems. Hence, Anomaly Detection in IT Operations traditionally tends to be focused on avoiding system disruption.

## What problems it solves
- Ever-increasing volume of logs in a distributed system, making it difficult to ensure that engineers can effectively troubleshoot incidents. 
- During an incident, the trial-and-error process of finding and confirming which logs are relevant to your investigation can be time consuming and laborious.

## What kind of metrics
Anomaly detection assists with visualizing and monitoring metrics that have predictable patterns. For example, my_site.page_views{*} is driven by user traffic and varies predictably by time of day and day of week. 

## Types of anomalous data
The major sources of data are logs and metrics. We use various types of log agents to collect the data.

## Data preparation
Log parsing
data aggregation
data normalization
Grouping
