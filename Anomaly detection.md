# ML for Anomaly detection algorithms

## Key Takeaways
- “AIOps” stands for “artificial intelligence for IT operations.” Originally coined by Gartner in 2017, it refers to the way data and information from an application environment are managed by an IT team
- Anomaly Detection is a fundamental Building Blocks of AIOps traditionally focused on avoiding system disruption.
- Scale observability from one system to the thousands of systems enterprises today tend to have and you have a data problem that humans cannot analyze. 

## What is Anomaly detection
In IT Operations, Anomaly Detection is a fundamental Building Blocks of AIOps – Artificial Intelligence in IT Operations. IT Operations is essentially about ensuring SLAs and the availability of IT systems. Hence, Anomaly Detection in IT Operations traditionally tends to be focused on avoiding system disruption.

## What problems it solves
- Ever-increasing volume of logs in a distributed system, making it difficult to ensure that engineers can effectively troubleshoot incidents. 
- During an incident, the trial-and-error process of finding and confirming which logs are relevant to your investigation can be time consuming and laborious.

## What kind of metrics
Anomaly detection assists with visualizing and monitoring metrics that have predictable patterns. For example, my_site.page_views{*} is driven by user traffic and varies predictably by time of day and day of week.
