# ML for Anomaly detection algorithms

## What is Anomaly detection
Anomaly

## What problems it solves
- Ever-increasing volume of logs in a distributed system, making it difficult to ensure that engineers can effectively troubleshoot incidents. 
- During an incident, the trial-and-error process of finding and confirming which logs are relevant to your investigation can be time consuming and laborious.

## What kind of metrics
Anomaly detection assists with visualizing and monitoring metrics that have predictable patterns. For example, my_site.page_views{*} is driven by user traffic and varies predictably by time of day and day of week.
