Carburettors:Combustion engine producing power by mixing fuel and air.
EE system were brught in to calculate the right mix of maximmum fuel efficiency and reduce pollution.
ECU is a type of embedded system. embedded system can be thought of as a purpose built computer with CPU, I/O and RAM. Initial ECU were for EFI (elctronic fuel injection) but now used in other domains.
SDV: Car functions are primarily defined by Software with OTA.
EE architectures:
Domain architecture
Zonal architecture
EE architectures are crucial to designing SDV. ECUs are at the core. ECU based on functions. Mostly used in ADAS. Now for other non-safety functions.
