With the increasing need for differentiating and improving bottomlines, organizations are constantly looking for effective ways to optimize their software development and delivery processes. The Spotify way of organizing teams by squads and tribes has gained a lot of popularity for improving collaboration and increasing autonomy. However, one critical prerequisite that often goes overlooked is the need to "correct" the technical architecture of applications which the teams will be looking after. If the architecture continues to be of a legacy style and team restructuring will fail to yield results and could even create more problems. despite the best of intentions. In this article, we will explore why addressing technical architecture is essential for successfully implementing the Spotify type of models within an organization.

## Overview of The Spotify Model
The Spotify model is a popular framework for organizing agile teams, primarily utilized by software development companies. It emphasizes cross-functional teams, autonomy, and continuous improvement. It consists of several squads, each with a specific mission, and related squads form tribes, which are further grouped into chapters and guilds to encourage knowledge sharing and collaboration.

## The Role of Technical Architecture
While the Spotify model offers a comprehensive structure for team organization, it does not directly address the technical aspects of software development. This is where the importance of correcting the technical architecture of applications comes into play. Technical architecture refers to the underlying design and structure of software systems, encompassing the choice of technologies, system components, and how they interact with each other.

## Benefits
Maintainability: Well-structured technical architecture simplifies the maintenance and support of applications. It facilitates the identification and resolution of issues, reduces the time required for bug fixes, and allows for seamless updates and enhancements.

Adaptability: In today's rapidly evolving technology landscape, organizations must be able to adapt to changes quickly. Correcting the technical architecture enables greater flexibility, making it easier to integrate new features, technologies, and third-party services. This adaptability empowers teams to respond to changing market demands more efficiently.

Collaboration and Cross-Functional Teams: The Spotify model emphasizes collaboration and cross-functional teams. However, if the technical architecture is flawed or inefficient, it can hinder effective collaboration and impede progress. A well-designed technical architecture fosters seamless integration between different teams, enhances communication, and promotes cross-team collaboration.

## Implementation Challenges
Addressing technical architecture challenges requires a concerted effort and investment of resources. Some common challenges organizations may face include legacy systems, technical debt, lack of standardized practices, and resistance to change. Overcoming these challenges demands a clear roadmap, collaboration between development and operations teams, and a commitment to continuous improvement.

## Org design 
Organization redesign is an essential component of most modernization programs. At a broad level it includes creating new roles, and restructuring existing teams with the objective of bringing in efficiency. Agile is one of the common guiding principle which gives the teams autonomy. The spotify model of tribes and squads is also adopted by many orgs albeit with differing terminologies. But the common principle continues to be building autonomous teams. This article however looks at the business and technical architecture which is not addressed may lead to failure of the model despite the best intentions of reorganization.

An org consists of several systems. Old system have one or more monoliths which are broken into smaller managable components during modernization.

## Technical Architecture

The technical architecture is hugely important for the way the teams are organized. The organizational structure must play in harmony with the technical architecture. Most organization cannot replicate in ditto the spotify way of working because their architecture will not allow it.

The architecture should support the autonomus way of working (not the other way around). This has resulted in a tight ecosystem of components and apps, each running and evolving independently. The overall evolution of the ecosystem is guided by a powerful architectural vision.

The product design can be kept cohesive by having senior product managers work tightly with squads, product owners, and designers. This coordination can get sometimes get tricky and become one of the key challenges. Designers work directly with squads, but also spend at least 20% of their time working together with other designers to keep the overall product design consistent.

## Managing Dependencies

Dependencies are one of the key challenges for working with autonomous teams. The more dependencies we have, the less effective we become.

For example, UX used to be mostly separate, which caused dependency problems (as shown in our dependency visualization spreadsheet above). Now design and UX is mostly integrated into the squads, which has reduced the problem. This is one example of a dependency reduction strategy.

Here are some other dependency reduction strategies we use:

Decide where to put dependencies. For example, we have an intentional dependency from feature squads to infrastructure squads. This is managable, since infrastructure squads generally have more predictable delivery times. Instead of trying to eliminate that dependency, we try to become good at managing it.

## Challenges
Some of our current challenges are:

Squad dependencies - how to minimize unnecessary dependencies, and optimize the necessary dependencies. This is always a challenge as the company grows.

How to balance between organizational focus (squads running in the same direction), and squad autonomy (squads getting to choose their own direction).

How to integrate design and development more tightly

How to avoid bottlenecking operations as the company grows, and enable squads to continuously deploy and experiment in production.

How to deal with “big projects” that involve the coordination of dozens of squads.

How to keep the product design cohesive while having many different squads working on it independently.

Don’t wait for stuff that isn’t ready.Solve the problem yourself instead. We adopt an open source model, so a squad is allowed to make the changes they need in another squad’s code, usually combined with conversations and code reviews.

Knowledge sharing.Sometimes a dependency is caused by lack of knowledge. This is solved by internal tech talks, doing “internships” in another squad to learn from them, or shifting responsibilities between squads where it makes sense.

Persistent dependency problems are sometimes resolved by splitting, combining, or rearranging squads.

## Conclusion
Correcting the technical architecture of applications is an essential prerequisite for effectively organizing teams according to the Spotify model. By prioritizing technical architecture, organizations can unlock the full potential of the model, enabling scalability, maintainability, adaptability, and fostering collaboration. While challenges may arise during the implementation process, the long-term benefits of an optimized technical architecture far outweigh the initial investment. Ultimately, investing in the correction of technical architecture sets the foundation for successful agile transformation and empowers teams to deliver high-quality software in a dynamic and competitive market.
